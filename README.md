Consider working as a data scientist for Zillow. Housing data with 80 features are provided. The goal is to isolate the important features and build  a model which can be used to predict the price of the houses. 
Since there are too many features, Principal Component Analysis was applied to reduce the number of features for the actual prediction model, without any loss of information.
